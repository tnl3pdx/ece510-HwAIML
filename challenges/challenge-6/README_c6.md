# Challenge 6

In this challenge, the goal is to implement a simple neuron that takes in two inputs and uses a sigmoid activation function. 



## Tasks for Challenge 6
    1. Implement a simple neuron (a.k.a. perceptron) with two inputs and a sigmoid activation function.
    2. Use the perceptron learning rule (Google or LLM it) to train the neuron to realize the following
    binary logic functions:
        a. NAND
        b. XOR
