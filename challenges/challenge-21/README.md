# Challenge 21

In this challenge, this focused on optimizing the project's HDL. This folder is very similar to [Challenge 18](https://github.com/tnl3pdx/ece510-HwAIML/tree/main/challenges/challenge-18), however, it has some useful scripts for importing project files and converting them into Verilog files.


## Dependancies

To use this folder, you will need the following:

1. SV2V
2. OpenLane 2 (installed into your home directory)
