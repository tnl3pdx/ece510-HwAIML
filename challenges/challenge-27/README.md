# Challenge 27

In this challenge, the goal was to create a cocotb testsuite to test with the project. I was able to implement steps 1, 2, 3, and 6 from this list, and I was able to get passing results for all of them.

# Usage

To start, begin the Python environment by typing:

    source start.sh

Once venv has been enabled, type the following:

    make

This will start the cocotb test suite and go through all tests in the test.py file.
