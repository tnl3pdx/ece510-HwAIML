# Challenge 10 / 11

Since both challenges 10 and 11 both are related to the Frozen Lake RL problem, I will put both challenges under the same directory. 

[Log for Challenge 10 and 11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qdvfSBpjJC5qA3KSEIu2Vc0hw0yR09CdDyHnmFWOv44/edit?usp=sharing)

## Tasks for Challenge 10

    1. Ask your favorite LLM to identity “computational bottlenecks” in the FrozenLake code from
    (https://github.com/ronanmmurphy/Q-Learning-Algorithm)
    2. Do the suggestions make sense? How well is it able to identity bottlenecks?
    3. Ask it to propose a HW implementation of the biggest bottleneck.
    4. Ask it to generate System Verilog code for the HW implementation.

## Tasks for Challenge 11

    1. Ask your favorite LLM to optimize the FrozenLake code from
    (https://github.com/ronanmmurphy/Q-Learning-Algorithm) for a GPU.
    2. Benchmark both the pure Python and the GPU-accelerated versions and compare. How much
    speed-up do you get?
